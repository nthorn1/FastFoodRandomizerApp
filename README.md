# Fast Food Randomizer App
The Fast Food Randomizer App selects and displays a fast food chain that is stored a local SQL server databse. From there, the user can choose to go to a detail page that displays the name of the restaurant and a picture of the chain that is collected by the Flickr API. Users also have the option of going to a page that allow them to add, but not removing new fast food locations to the database. The page also validates that any location being added contains only letters, numbers, and spaces.
